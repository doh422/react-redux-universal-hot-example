    // many many times during the lifecycle of the page, but componentDidMount() is only
    // on first mount.

    // Note that we put it in componentDidMount (as opposed to componentWillMount) for two reasons:
    // A) componentWillMount is also called on the server when doing the server-side rendering, but
    //    we don't have the Traitify API there.
    // B) The Traitify code is assuming that it will be able to find the element on the page, so it
    //    must be called after the component DID mount, not before it mounts in component WILL mount.
